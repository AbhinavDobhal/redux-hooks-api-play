Playing around with the new Redux hooks api with type script. 

The plan is to compare the perfomance of connect and traditional methods of connecting to the store vs the new useSelector hook.

I am also really curious on the performance with these new hooks and how they will work in conjunction with useMemo and useCallback. 

I also plan to add the Reselect Library to add memoization, which will needed to be accounted for.
