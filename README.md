Playing around with the new Redux hooks with typescript. 

The plan is to compare the perfomance of connect and traditional methods of connecting to the store vs the new useSelector hook.

I am also really curious on the performance with these new hooks and how they will work in conjunction with useMemo and useCallback. 

Added Reselect but will need to do a usecase where we use a selector in multiple component instances.
